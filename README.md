How to play:

Wordle selects a random five letter (english) word from gave.txt. It's your mission to guess the word! After guessing, you'll be given a response: A white square indicates that the letter in this position is wrong. A yellow square indicates that the letter in this position is part of the word, however in the wrong position. A green square indicates that your letter is both in the word, and in the correct position.

Good luck!
